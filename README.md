# php-mvc-productlist-task
A simple PHP MVC web app for adding/deleting products.

Tools used:
- Plain PHP utilizing the MVC architecture 
- MySQL
- Sass (SCSS) - compiled with sass live compiler (vscode extension) to keep the project minimal
- I didn't use any css liberary, to showcase my css skills
- I used vue CDN in order not to complicate the project with vue-cli
- I followed PSR-1 & PSR-12 recommendations

** To run the project, All you need to do is change the DB credentials in app/utils/database.php and you should be good to GO.

** This task is made specifically to be reviewed by Scandiweb team.
